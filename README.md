# ScriptX Task

Project made for an internship application process at ScriptX

Project Should be made for android. Coding done on Windows11 machine and tested with Iphone.

Wanted to test with android still using expo, but either the android device was bugged or something hindered the process, therefore all testing was done with and Iphone.

# To run application
Fork or just download the repository and navigate to ScriptXCinema directory
```
cd ScriptXCinema
```

To test application i used Expo, which allowed me to test my project on my iphone as my android device was acting up for some reason.
To use expo for testing of the application, you will need to use this command and get the Expo Go app on your mobile device:
```
npx expo start
```

Scan the generated qr code on your device and it will open your expo app, with which you will be able to try out the application. 
If you need to test out a web version of this application, use this command:
```
npm run start
```
